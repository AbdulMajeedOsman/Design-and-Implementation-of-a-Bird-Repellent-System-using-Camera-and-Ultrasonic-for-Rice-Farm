#### Project Abstract
Bird damage to crops is a major problem in agriculture. Traditional methods of bird control, such as shooting and poisoning, are ineffective and harmful to the environment. This paper proposes a smart ultrasonic bird-repellent system that uses an ESP32 camera to detect birds and trigger an ultrasonic sensor to determine their range and emit ultrasound to deter the birds. The ESP32 camera uses machine learning techniques to identify the birds, and an ultrasonic sensor is triggered when a bird is detected within the range of the field. The sensor activates an ultrasonic sound wave to cause the birds to fly off. The system was tested in a field trial and was effective in deterring birds and safe for humans and other animals. The proposed system is effective, environmentally friendly and safe.
